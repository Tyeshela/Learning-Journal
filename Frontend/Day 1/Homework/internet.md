# Day 1 Homework: Exploring Internet Basics

Welcome to the Day 1 Homework section of my learning journal repository! In this assignment, I've explored the concepts covered in Day 1, focusing on how the internet works, HTTP, domain names, hosting, DNS, and web browsers. Below are the completed tasks and answers to the questions.

## Tasks

1. **Research**:

   - **How does the internet work?**
     The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices. It operates on a decentralized system, transmitting data in small packets through routers and switches, following TCP/IP protocols.

   - **What is HTTP?**
     HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the transfer of web content between servers and browsers.

   - **What is a Domain Name?**
     A domain name is a human-readable web address used to identify websites on the internet, translating to IP addresses.

   - **What is Hosting?**
     Web hosting stores and makes website files accessible on the internet. Various hosting services offer different resources and control levels.

   - **DNS and How It Works**
     DNS translates domain names to IP addresses, facilitating web navigation by mapping human-readable addresses to computer-friendly ones.

   - **Browsers and How They Work**
     Web browsers retrieve and render web content, sending HTTP requests to web servers and displaying web pages.

2. **Diagram**: (Diagram creation is not provided here. Please create a visual representation of how data flows over the internet.)

3. **Real-World Examples**: (Real-world examples and case studies are not provided here. You can explore practical applications and importance of internet concepts with online resources.)

## Questions

4. **HTTP in Action**:

   - HTTP is a request-response protocol. When you enter a web address, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website.
   - The server processes the request and, if successful, responds with the web page's content.
   - HTTP methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), etc.
   - Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

5. **Domain Names**:
   Researching Google's domain name history, I found that it initially used "google.stanford.edu" when it was hosted at Stanford University. Later, it transitioned to "google.com" for branding purposes.

6. **DNS Exploration**:
   DNS ensures users can access websites by domain names. When you enter a web address, your device queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address, allowing connection to the website's server.

7. **Browser's Functionality**:

   - Browsers provide features like tabbed browsing, bookmarks, and extensions to enhance user experience.
   - They support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web content.
   - Security features like HTTPS and privacy settings protect users online.
